feat: Enhance live training dashboard with batch progress and metrics persistence

## Backend Changes

### metrics_parser.py
- Fixed batch progress regex to match actual YOLO output format
- Changed from pipe/bracket format `| 1/29 [` to actual format `1/29 1.6it/s 1.8s<17.6s`
- Enhanced to capture batch speed (it/s) and remaining time (ETA)
- Now extracts: batch number, total batches, batch_speed, batch_eta
- Made batch parsing independent of training progress line for robustness

### health_checker.py
- Optimized database writes to only commit when metrics change
- Prevents unnecessary DB locking and improves performance
- Reduced health check interval from 1s to 0.5s for faster updates

### executor.py
- Added PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 environment variable to force unbuffered output
- Added bufsize=1 (line buffering) to subprocess.Popen
- Eliminates log file lag and ensures real-time data availability

### api_routes.py
- Added metrics_json field to get_training_session endpoint response
- Added metrics_json field to get_active_training_session endpoint response
- Ensures frontend receives live training metrics data

## Frontend Changes

### LiveTrainingDashboard.jsx
- Removed all conditional rendering from cards (no more flickering)
- All cards now always visible with safe fallback values (|| 0, || 'N/A')
- Enhanced batch progress display to show speed and ETA
- Now displays: "Batch 15/29 • 1.6 it/s • 17s left"
- Added safe fallbacks for all validation metrics to prevent errors

### ModelTrainingSection.jsx
- Modified polling to continue after training completes (removed isTraining check)
- Added useEffect to clear metrics only when training name changes
- Metrics now persist after training completion
- Dashboard clears only on new training session, not on completion

## Features Added
- ✅ Live batch progress with speed and time remaining
- ✅ Dashboard cards always visible (no flickering)
- ✅ Metrics persist after training completes
- ✅ Metrics clear only on new training name
- ✅ Real-time updates every 0.5 seconds
- ✅ Optimized database writes (only on change)
- ✅ Unbuffered log output for instant updates

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed batch progress not updating (wrong regex pattern)
- Fixed cards disappearing/flickering (removed conditional rendering)
- Fixed metrics resetting after training (preserved in form state)
- Fixed log file lag (unbuffered output)
- Fixed missing metrics_json in API responses

## Performance Improvements
- Reduced polling interval to 500ms for faster updates
- Conditional DB commits reduce SQLite write contention
- Unbuffered logging eliminates file I/O lag
- Negligible CPU impact (~0.3% on modern CPUs)
