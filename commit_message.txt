feat: Finalize live training dashboard metrics persistence and visibility

## Frontend Changes
- **ModelTrainingSection.jsx**: 
  - Fixed metrics clearing logic to persist data after training completes.
  - Metrics now only clear when a NEW, non-empty training name is entered.
  - Added `useEffect` to load the last completed training session's metrics on page mount.
- **LiveTrainingDashboard.jsx**:
  - Added conditional rendering to hide the dashboard when no metrics exist (e.g., status='queued').
  - Prevents displaying empty "0/0" states before training starts.

## Backend Changes
- **api_routes.py**:
  - Added new endpoint `GET /projects/{id}/training/last-completed`.
  - Fetches the most recent session with `status='completed'` to restore dashboard state.

## Fixes
- Resolved issue where metrics would reset to zero immediately after training finished.
- Resolved issue where dashboard showed empty zeros when creating a new training.
- Dashboard now persists across page reloads and backend restarts.
