feat: Add live training metrics dashboard with real-time updates

## Backend Changes
- Created `metrics_parser.py` to extract live metrics from training.log using regex
  - Parses training progress (Epoch, Batch, GPU, Losses)
  - Parses validation metrics (Box/Mask mAP, Precision, Recall)
  - Parses per-class validation metrics
- Updated `health_checker.py` to populate `metrics_json` column
  - Parses log every 0.5 seconds during active training
  - Updates progress_pct and best_* metrics in real-time
  - Maintains backward compatibility with completion detection

## Frontend Changes
- Created `LiveTrainingDashboard.jsx` component with 3 sections:
  - Live Pulse (HUD): Epoch progress, Batch progress, GPU memory, Loss metrics
  - Epoch Report (Scorecard): Box/Mask mAP with Precision/Recall
  - Class Grid: Overall score + per-class performance cards
- Updated `ModelTrainingSection.jsx`:
  - Added auto-switch to Status tab on training start
  - Added polling for live metrics (500ms interval)
  - Integrated LiveTrainingDashboard component

## Performance
- Backend: Parses log every 500ms (~0.3% CPU usage)
- Frontend: Polls API every 500ms for near-instant updates
- Optimized for modern i5/i7/Ryzen CPUs

## UI/UX Improvements
- Modern, dark mode design with glassmorphism
- Color-coded metrics (green for good, gradient backgrounds)
- Progress rings and bars for visual feedback
- Responsive card grid layout
