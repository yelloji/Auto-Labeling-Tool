fix: Batch regex and metrics persistence final fixes

## Fixes Applied
- **metrics_parser.py**: Fixed batch regex to match new log format with brackets (28/29 [00:01<00:00, 7.065it/s])
- **ModelTrainingSection.jsx**: Preserve liveMetrics when form resets after training completion

## Issues Resolved
- Batch count now shows correct total (29/29 instead of 20/20 or 5/5)
- Batch speed and remaining time display correctly
- Dashboard metrics persist after training completes (no disappearing)
- Form reset no longer clears final metrics
