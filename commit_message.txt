fix: Dashboard persistence and batch progress improvements

## Frontend Fixes
- **ModelTrainingSection.jsx**: Stop polling when training completes (preserve final metrics)
- **LiveTrainingDashboard.jsx**: Fixed conditional rendering to only hide when metrics are truly empty

## Backend Fixes
- **metrics_parser.py**: 
  - Fixed batch regex to require 'it/s' (avoids matching epoch numbers like "1/20")
  - Added None checks for optional batch_speed and batch_eta to prevent float(None) crash

## Issues Resolved
- Dashboard no longer disappears after training completes
- Batch count now shows correct total (29/29 instead of varying 5/5, 20/20)
- Batch speed and remaining time display correctly when available
- Parser no longer crashes when batch progress lacks speed/time data
