feat: Implement Live Training Metrics Dashboard

This commit introduces a real-time dashboard for monitoring training progress.

Backend Changes:
- Added `metrics_parser.py`: Implements regex-based parsing of `training.log` to extract live metrics (Epoch, Batch, GPU, Losses, Validation mAP).
- Updated `health_checker.py`: 
  - Polls training logs every 0.5 seconds during active training.
  - Updates `metrics_json` in the database only when values change to reduce DB contention.
- Updated `executor.py`: Forced unbuffered output (`PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`) to ensure logs are written instantly for real-time feedback.
- Updated `api_routes.py`: Added `metrics_json` to `get_training_session` and `get_active_training_session` responses.

Frontend Changes:
- Created `LiveTrainingDashboard.jsx`:
  - "Live Pulse" HUD: Shows circular epoch progress, batch progress bar, GPU memory, and loss metrics.
  - "Epoch Report": Displays Box and Mask mAP/Precision/Recall after each validation epoch.
  - "Class Grid": Shows overall model score and per-class performance cards.
- Updated `ModelTrainingSection.jsx`:
  - Auto-switches to the "Status" tab when training starts.
  - Polls the API every 500ms for live metric updates.
  - Integrates the new `LiveTrainingDashboard` component.

Database:
- Updated `database.db` and exports with latest schema/data.
