## 🚀 How to Install and Run

### ⚡ **SUPER SIMPLE - 3 COMMANDS ONLY!**

**Step 1:** Download the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yelloji/Auto-Labeling-Tool.git
```

**Step 2:** Go into the folder
```bash
cd Auto-Labeling-Tool
```

**Step 3:** Run it!

### 🕐 **First Time Running (Takes 3-5 minutes)**

When you run `python start.py` for the **first time**, here's what happens:

```
🏷️ Starting Auto-Labeling-Tool...
==================================
🔍 Checking what you need...
📦 Installing Node.js... ✅ Done!
📦 Installing Python packages... ✅ Done!
📦 Installing website files... ✅ Done!
🚀 Starting the app...
✅ Backend started on port 12000
✅ Frontend started on port 12001

🎉 Auto-Labeling-Tool is now running!
Open your browser: http://localhost:12001
```

**What gets installed automatically:**
- ✅ Node.js (if you don't have it)
- ✅ All Python packages needed
- ✅ All website files needed
- ✅ Everything else required

---

### ⚡ **Second Time Running (Takes 10-20 seconds)**

When you run `python start.py` **again**, it's super fast:

```
🏷️ Starting Auto-Labeling-Tool...
==================================
🔍 Checking what you need...
✅ Node.js found - good!
✅ Python packages found - good!
✅ Website files found - good!
🚀 Starting the app...
✅ Backend started on port 12000
✅ Frontend started on port 12001

🎉 Auto-Labeling-Tool is now running!
Open your browser: http://localhost:12001
```

**Why it's faster:**
- ✅ Everything is already installed
- ✅ Just starts the app directly
- ✅ No downloading or installing needed

---

### 🎯 **What You Need (Only Python!)**

**Required:**
- ✅ **Python 3.8 or newer** (that's it!)

**Installed Automatically:**

### 🗂️ **What Files Get Created:**

After running the first time, you'll see these new folders:
```
Auto-Labeling-Tool/
├── backend/
│   └── venv/              ← Python packages stored here
├── frontend/
│   └── node_modules/      ← Website files stored here
└── database.db           ← Your data stored here
```

**Don't delete these folders!** They contain all the installed software and your data.

---

### ❓ **Common Questions:**

**Q: Do I need to install Node.js myself?**  
A: No! The app installs it automatically if you don't have it.

**Q: What if something goes wrong?**  
A: Just run `python start.py` again. It will fix itself.

**Q: How do I stop the app?**  
A: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where you ran the command.

**Q: How do I start it again later?**  
A: Just run `python start.py` again. It will be much faster the second time.

**Q: Can I use this on Windows/Mac/Linux?**  
A: Yes! It works on all operating systems.
