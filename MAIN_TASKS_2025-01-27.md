# Main Tasks - January 27, 2025

*Created: January 27, 2025*

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Auto-Export System Implementation
- [x] **Auto-Export System Fixed** - Resolved directory path issues where `database_exports` was created in `backend` folder instead of project root
- [x] **Export Configuration** - Fixed `get_auto_exporter()` to use correct absolute export directory from `export_config.py`
- [x] **Parameter Fixes** - Corrected `initialize_auto_export` parameter mismatches in `main.py`
- [x] **Database Monitoring** - Auto-export system now properly monitors database changes and exports to project root

## Current Priority Tasks

### High Priority Issues

1. **Smart Segmentation Tool Upgrade**
   - Upgrade to modern pixel-level accuracy with real-time mouse tracking
   - Implement smooth polygon highlighting that follows mouse cursor movement
   - Add real-time shape preview and selection confirmation for smart segmentation

2. **Release System Fixes**
   - Fix release system ZIP file data.yaml showing all available labels instead of only used labels
   - Fix label ID mapping in release system - currently showing ID 0 for all labels
   - Ensure labels.txt coordinates remain correct while fixing label ID assignment

3. **Project Data Export Issues**
   - Fix CSV export format issues in project data
   - Resolve data inconsistencies in exported files
   - Improve export reliability and data integrity

4. **Advanced Dashboard Model Manager**
   - Implement more flexible model management system
   - Add advanced configuration options for model parameters
   - Enhance model switching and performance monitoring

5. **Release History System**
   - Implement comprehensive release history tracking
   - Add release versioning and changelog functionality
   - Create release comparison and rollback capabilities

### Task Status

#### Completed
- [x] Auto-export system directory path fixes
- [x] Export configuration parameter corrections
- [x] Database monitoring setup

#### In Progress
- [ ] Smart segmentation tool modernization
- [ ] Polygon highlighting improvements
- [ ] Shape preview and selection
- [ ] Release system data.yaml filtering
- [ ] Label ID mapping correction
- [ ] Coordinate accuracy verification

#### Planned
- [ ] Project data CSV export fixes
- [ ] Advanced dashboard model manager implementation
- [ ] Release history system development
- [ ] Release history code review and optimization

### Notes

- Priority is on maintaining existing functionality while implementing fixes
- Release system issues are lower risk and should be addressed first
- Smart segmentation upgrade is higher risk due to potential impact on existing workflows
