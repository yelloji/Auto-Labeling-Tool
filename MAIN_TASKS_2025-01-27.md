## Current Priority Tasks

### High Priority Issues

1. **Smart Segmentation Tool Upgrade**
   - Upgrade to modern pixel-level accuracy with real-time mouse tracking
   - Implement smooth polygon highlighting that follows mouse cursor movement
   - Add real-time shape preview and selection confirmation for smart segmentation

2. **Release System Fixes**
   - Fix release system ZIP file data.yaml showing all available labels instead of only used labels
   - Fix label ID mapping in release system - currently showing ID 0 for all labels
   - Ensure labels.txt coordinates remain correct while fixing label ID assignment

### Task Status

- [ ] Smart segmentation tool modernization
- [ ] Polygon highlighting improvements
- [ ] Shape preview and selection
- [ ] Release system data.yaml filtering
- [ ] Label ID mapping correction
- [ ] Coordinate accuracy verification

### Notes

- Priority is on maintaining existing functionality while implementing fixes
- Release system issues are lower risk and should be addressed first
- Smart segmentation upgrade is higher risk due to potential impact on existing workflows
