## Change

* Update `debug_database.py` to include `project_id` when printing AiModel rows.

## Files

* `V:\stage-1-labeling-app\app-3-fix-release-system-422-error\debug_database.py`

## Result

* Running the script will show `id, name, type, format, file_path, project_id, nc, created_at` for models, making it easy to verify global vs project-scoped models.
