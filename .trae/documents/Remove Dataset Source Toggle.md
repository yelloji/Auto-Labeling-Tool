## Change

* Remove the “Dataset Source” radio group from DatasetSection; keep dropdown-only for releases.

* Always assume `release_zip`; no developer custom path shown.

## Files

* Update `frontend/src/components/project-workspace/ModelTrainingSection/Dataset/DatasetSection.jsx` only.

## Result

* Cleaner UI, no wasted space; user picks dataset from releases dropdown.
